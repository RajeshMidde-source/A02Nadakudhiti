I created 3 pages and the info in them is as described below:

Page 1 :In the home page I added a new button without any function and named as A02.
        
Page 2: Created a temp.js file for calculating the temperature in required units and added a inverse button as we must have a 2 inputs and atleast one calculated value.

Page 3: I attached my linkedin, bitbucket and github profile to the contact page.
